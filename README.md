# 2dirRen-Launcher_GtaV
basically a batch script to allow you to swap names of 2 folders within a directory automatically.
If you have one modded and one original version of a game and you want to be able to run the game without copying files rather just renaming the folders and also do so automatically not manually then this script will help.
its compaitable with Epic Version of gtaV
it also disables wifi till the time you specify
place out side of GTAV folder and have other GTAV2 folder also in the same directory
run as adminstrator.

So bascially you can also modify this code to just swap names of 2 folders whenever required.
It also has many other small pieces of code which I will upload later perhaps..
it uses bubble sort generic swapping algorithm.

program concept is inpired by achmadfauzihamibowo; not the code, I know its sloppy not clean but it works so don't judge me Lol, feel free to use/commit/fork whatever..
